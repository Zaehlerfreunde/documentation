Here you will find the explanation for using the private customer area.

Thank you for your trust in our solution. We are continuously working to further develop the product. For feedback or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us via email or the chat function on the website at the bottom right: kontakt@zaehlerfreunde.com!

Here you can find the explanation for using our solution if you are an SME customer:

[Guide for Zaehlerfreunde Business Customers](../business/business.md)

Here is a table of contents for the guide:

## Registration

Depending on whether you are a private customer or receive the solution through your municipal utility, the registration process looks slightly different. However, the differences are only in small details.

In the first step, when you land on our website, we recommend that you accept all cookies so that we can offer you the best experience on our platform.

![Cookie Acceptance](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-06-28_um_13.46.38.png)

Then click on "Private Customer" or "Company" and register. For registration, you can also use your Google or Apple account.

![Screenshot 2024-06-28 at 13.46.49.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-06-28_um_13.46.49.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled.png)

Once that is done, we will ask for your name and your consent to our terms and conditions.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%201.png)

We will then immediately send you an email with a confirmation link. Once you have clicked the link in the email, you can confirm on our platform that you have verified your email address.

![Screenshot 2024-06-28 at 13.48.10.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-06-28_um_13.48.10.png)

## Creating New Properties and Adding Devices

After the email has been confirmed, you will land on your personal dashboard. Since no property and therefore no device has been created yet, it still looks a bit empty:

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%203.png)

Go to the plus sign next to "Property" in the top left and create a new property. The platform will guide you through the process independently. You can also create multiple properties here and subordinate them hierarchically. An example of this is the visualization of a multi-family house, including the detailed consumption data of the individual apartments. Such logic can be visualized using "grouping".

After the property has been created, we can add a device:

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%204.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%206.png)

## Devices

The "Devices" tab is on the left side, relatively far down.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%207.png)

Here you have a large selection of devices that you can connect. A list of all supported devices can be found on our homepage.

![2.png](/img/user-guides/common/2.png)

Since meters can measure the electricity demand of the entire house or cover individual areas, we need to know whether the meter you are currently connecting is your main device or not, in order to calculate it correctly with your tariff.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%208.png)

The connection process will then be explained to you step by step. After you have successfully connected a device, your dashboard will slowly begin to fill up.

After you have added the main device, you can add more devices and create logic. Once you have created more than 10 devices or sub-properties, they will be counted together and displayed here.

![1.png](/img/user-guides/common/1.png)

In the next step, you can (if not already done) enter your tariff details so that we can accurately calculate your costs. You can find this option either directly on the dashboard or in the menu under Management > Property.

## Dashboard

Your dashboard now shows all the devices you have connected at the top, along with when the last data was transmitted and the real-time power. The upper area of the graph shows your consumption, while the lower area shows the feed-in from your solar system, if you have one. A feed-in tariff of 7 cents/kWh is automatically assumed, but you can adjust this as you wish under "Management" > "Property". Here you can also visualize daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly data. This applies not only to consumption in watts but also to costs and remuneration, CO2 emissions, market prices, and meter readings. You can download this data at any time via CSV export.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%209.png)

## Meter Readings

Of course, you can display the readings not only from the main device but from all devices. Below, you can also see the consumption compared to the previous month and the costs. Here too, you can display individual devices or readings, or the main device.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2010.png)

## Recommendations

You can also set a goal for how much you want to consume. To help you reach this goal, or even achieve better ones, you will be shown tips on how to save electricity.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/private/Untitled%2011.png)

## Tips and Shop

Based on your information and consumption, you will receive tips tailored specifically to you under "Tips," as well as general electricity-saving advice.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/private/Untitled%2012.png)

Directly below the electricity-saving tips, you will see a shop. Products are listed here with which you can measure and visualize your consumption even better to identify the real energy guzzlers in your household.

## Smart Control and Logic

The topic of "Smart Control" deals with energy management and logic.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2013.png)

To add a new automation, simply click the corresponding button, and a window will open for you to enter the desired logic. In this example, we want to charge our car when our solar system is producing power and the feed-in is positive. However, you can also control all sorts of devices or send notifications.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2014.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2015.png)

After you have created the automation, it will be displayed. You can edit, delete, or add more.

With automations, you can also choose the option to switch devices on or off or send notifications when a certain threshold is reached. You can also have this threshold displayed in the consumption graph.

## Reporting

To fully utilize the potential of the data, we have developed a comprehensive reporting function. This allows you to individually define which data should be prepared as visualized reports and at what interval.
In the menu on the left, you will find the "Reporting" tab. Once you open it, you will get an overview of all created reports and the reports you have already received.

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.05.07.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.05.07.png)

To create a new report, click "Create now". In this area, you can give the report a name, select the metrics to be evaluated (such as consumption, production, costs, remuneration, and CO2), and define the interval at which the report should be created (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.05.34.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.05.34.png)

After you have selected a start date and saved the new reporting rule, you will get an overview of the report to be created and the time at which it will be generated.

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.05.54.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.05.54.png)

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.06.02.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.06.02.png)

Here you can see an example of what the report might look like.

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.08.56.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.08.56.png)

## Simulator

In the simulator, you can calculate different variants of mini-photovoltaic systems with various mounting options.

The option to simulate a large PV system and a battery storage system is currently under development and will be available soon!

Here you can see, for example, how to simulate a balcony power plant. At the end, you will get concrete suggestions on how much it would cost and how much you can profit from it.

## Tariff Change

Here, we constantly look for better and cheaper tariffs based on your consumption. If we find one for you, we will display it there.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/8fd384e8-f8d5-480b-b1c2-7b091ada1b48.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2018.png)

## Management

Under the "Verwaltung" tab, information about your property is listed. Here you can see general information as well as information about your tariff. Additionally, you can view all connected devices and invoices here, so you can find and access everything conveniently in one place.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2019.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/private/Untitled%2022.png)

In our premium membership, you can add other users to the same property under "Users". This allows you, for example, to invite your entire family to view the same household.

We wish you a lot of fun with our platform! If you have any questions or if something isn't working as you imagine, feel free to write to us anytime via the chat or at support@zaehlerfreunde.com, and we will find a solution for you.
