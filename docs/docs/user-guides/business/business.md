# Guide for Zählerfreunde Business Customers

Thank you for your trust in our **business customer solution**. We are continuously working to further develop the product. For feedback or questions, please do not hesitate to contact us by email: [kontakt@zaehlerfreunde.com](mailto:kontakt@zaehlerfreunde.com)!

With the Zählerfreunde solution, you can keep an optimal eye on your consumption. For example, monitor the electricity usage of your cooling units over the weekend and ensure that no products are damaged. You will receive immediate notifications for unusually high consumption and can request reports on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

Particularly interesting are the comprehensive **government subsidies**, as our solution is officially recognized by BaFa as [**eligible energy management software**](https://www.bafa.de/DE/Energie/Energieeffizienz/Energieeffizienz_und_Prozesswaerme/Modul3_Energiemanagementsysteme/ems_liste_foerderfaehige_software.html). We assist in the implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an energy management system according to DIN EN ISO 50001. You can find more information about possible subsidies here: https://www.foerderdatenbank.de/FDB/Content/DE/Foerderprogramm/Bund/BMWi/energieeffizienz-u-prozesswaerme-zuschuss-3.html

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled.png)

Once that is done, we will ask for your name or the company name and for your consent to our Terms and Conditions.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%201.png)

We will then immediately send you an email with a confirmation link. Once you have clicked the link in the email, you can confirm on our platform that you have verified your email address.

![Screenshot 2024-06-28 at 13.48.10.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-06-28_um_13.48.10.png)

## Creating New Properties and Adding Devices

After the email has been confirmed, you will land on your personal dashboard. Since no property and therefore no device has been created yet, it still looks a bit empty:

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%203.png)

Go to the plus sign next to "Property" in the top left and create a new property. The platform will guide you through the process independently. You can also create multiple properties here and subordinate them hierarchically. An example of this is the visualization of a multi-family house, including the detailed consumption data of the individual apartments. Another example would be a production site, an office, and a retail space. Such logic can be visualized using "grouping".

After the property has been created, you can add a device:

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%206.png)

## Devices

The "Devices" tab is on the left side, relatively far down.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%207.png)

Here you have a large selection of devices that you can connect. A list of all supported devices can be found on our homepage.

![2.png](/img/user-guides/common/2.png)

Since meters can measure the electricity demand of the entire building or cover individual areas, we need to know whether the meter you are currently connecting is your main device or not, in order to calculate it correctly with your tariff.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%208.png)

The connection process will then be explained to you step by step. After you have successfully connected a device, your dashboard will slowly begin to fill up.

Already have a smart metering system (smart electricity meter) installed? We will take care of collecting the data from your metering point operator: To do this, please provide your metering location ID and metering point operator (you can find this on your electricity bill).

![Screenshot 2025-02-16 at 14.01.08.png](/img/user-guides/business/Bildschirmfoto_2025-02-16_um_14.01.08.png)

After you have added the main device, you can add more devices and create logic. Once you have created more than 10 devices or sub-properties, they will be summarized and displayed here.

![1.png](/img/user-guides/common/1.png)

In the next step, you can (if not already done) enter your tariff details so that we can accurately calculate your costs. You can find this option either directly on the dashboard or in the menu under Management > Property.

## Dashboard

Your dashboard now shows all the devices you have connected in the upper area, along with when the last data was transmitted and the real-time power. The upper area of the graph shows your consumption, while the lower area shows the feed-in from your solar system, if you have one. A feed-in tariff of 7 cents/kWh is automatically assumed, but you can adjust this as you wish under "Management" > "Property". Here you can also visualize daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly data. This applies not only to consumption in watts but also to costs and remuneration, CO2 emissions, market prices, and meter readings. You can download this data at any time via CSV export.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%209.png)

## Readings

Of course, you can display the readings not only from the main device but from all devices. Below, you can also see the consumption compared to the previous month and the costs. Here too, you can display individual devices or readings, or the main device.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2010.png)

## Energy Management Key Figures

On the dashboard, below the graph, you have the option to select and display additional energy management key figures. However, some of these key figures first require the input of additional data, such as tariff details and reference values for costs, remuneration, and CO2 emissions. Market prices are only displayed if a dynamic tariff is stored.

![s.001.png](/img/user-guides/business/s.001.png)

## Reference Values

You must first activate reference values for your own properties for them to be displayed. Under the 'Property' item, you can click on 'Reference Values' to set the reference and benchmark values for your property. This allows, for example, the energy consumption and costs per square meter or per employee to be clearly displayed on the dashboard. This function also facilitates the comparison of different locations.

![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 14.57.22.png](/img/user-guides/business/Bildschirmfoto_2025-01-27_um_14.57.22.png)

## Load Duration Curve

A load duration curve represents the duration (in hours) during which a certain power level (in kW) is exceeded. The curve shows how long a device or a consumer operates at different power levels within a specific period. It is often used for analyzing the load profile in the energy industry to optimize the efficiency and utilization of plants.

For companies with an annual consumption of over 100,000 kWh, peak shaving is of particular importance, as the maximum power affects the grid costs.

![Screenhots.001.png](/img/user-guides/business/Screenhots.001.png)

## Smart Control and Logic

The topic of "Smart Control" deals with energy management and logic.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2011.png)

To add a new automation, simply click the corresponding button, and a window will open for you to enter the desired logic. In this example, we want to charge our car when our solar system is producing power and the feed-in is positive. However, you can also control all sorts of devices or send notifications.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2012.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2013.png)

After you have created the automation, it will be displayed. You can edit, delete, or add more.

## Reporting

To fully utilize the potential of the data, we have developed a comprehensive reporting function. This allows you to individually define which data should be prepared as visualized reports and at what interval.
In the menu on the left, you will find the "Reporting" tab. Once you open it, you will get an overview of all created reports and the reports you have already received.

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.05.07.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.05.07.png)

To create a new report, click "Create now". In this area, you can give the report a name, select the metrics to be evaluated (such as consumption, production, costs, remuneration, and CO2), and define the interval at which the report should be created (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.05.34.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.05.34.png)

After you have selected a start date and saved the new reporting rule, you will get an overview of the report to be created and the time at which it will be generated.

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.05.54.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.05.54.png)

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.06.02.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.06.02.png)

Here you can see an example of what the report might look like.

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.08.56.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.08.56.png)

![Screenshot 2024-09-03 at 09.09.05.png](/img/user-guides/common/Bildschirmfoto_2024-09-03_um_09.09.05.png)

## Simulator

In the simulator, you can calculate different variants of mini-photovoltaic systems with various mounting options. This is particularly interesting for companies that own smaller office buildings or additional employee apartments or similar properties.

The option to simulate a large PV system and a battery storage system is currently under development and will be available soon!

Here you can see, for example, how to simulate a balcony power plant. At the end, you will get concrete suggestions on how much it would cost and how much you can profit from it.

## Tariff Change

Here, we constantly look for better and cheaper tariffs based on your consumption. If we find one for you, we will display it there.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/8fd384e8-f8d5-480b-b1c2-7b091ada1b48.png)

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2018.png)

## Shop

Directly below the tariff change, you will see a shop. Products are listed here with which you can measure and visualize your consumption even better to identify the real energy guzzlers in your company.

## Management

Under the "Management" tab, information about your property is listed. Here you can see general information as well as information about your tariff. Additionally, you can view all connected devices and invoices here, so you can find and access everything conveniently in one place.

![Untitled](/img/user-guides/common/Untitled%2019.png)

**Virtual Sum Meters:**

With this function, you can combine several meters/devices - this is particularly useful for summarizing multiple values that are important for internal analysis or reporting.

## Data Import

-   Overview of data import options, including service providers such as metergrid, BlueMetering, and metiundo, as well as via CSV import.
-   The advantage here is that all existing customer files can be easily imported and integrated into the platform.
-   Adding historical consumption data: There is no additional work for you or the end customer, and existing data can continue to be used without being lost.
    ![Screenshot 2024-08-05 at 15.45.08.png](/img/user-guides/business/Bildschirmfoto_2024-08-05_um_15.45.08.png)

## Data Export

All data can, of course, also be exported as a XAP file. This helps in normalizing the data and is important for further applications that use the data (e.g., ESG software).

![Screenshot 2024-08-05 at 15.46.12.png](/img/user-guides/business/Bildschirmfoto_2024-08-05_um_15.46.12.png)

## Data Forwarding

Data forwarding is ideal for normalizing all data (smart meters as well as IoT devices) and continuously forwarding it to third parties, such as billing service providers. Via data forwarding, the data can also be fed into forecasting tools to optimize the electricity purchasing strategy.

The technical setup of the forwarding is explained step-by-step when you click on the green "Set up forwarding" button. Other formats can be added individually upon request.

![Screenshot 2024-08-05 at 16.31.59.png](/img/user-guides/business/Bildschirmfoto_2024-08-05_um_16.31.59.png)

## API

Our API can be used for many purposes. Primarily, it serves to save costs in the long run by eliminating the need for normal market communication (MSCONS/AS4) and forwarding data more quickly. Via this API, new properties and meters can be added fully automatically, and users can be created automatically. The exact instructions for the API can be found here:
